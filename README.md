# Project Timer Challenge

## The Challenge

This application is a loose clone of the application [Toggl](https://toggl.com). The repository contains some issues: [X] bugs we would like you to fix, and [X] features that we want you to implement. To take the challenge:

- Fork this repository
- In your own copy, solve the bugs and implement the features outlined in the issues.
- Each issue is considered "done" when:
  - The code for the solution has been written and is demonstrably correct (the bug is gone, the feature works).
  - Tests have been written that verify the above.
  - All tests are passing.
  - This README has been updated to reflect any relevant changes (features only).

### Hints for success

• Organize your solutions logically, either by commits or even by branches. This makes it easier to see your process.
• Commit often, and use descriptive commit messages. Each commit should be easily summarized in a short phrase. If you find yourself writing "and" a lot, it's probable that you have more than one commit on your hands.
• Do not try to solve all of the issues at once. Tackle each ticket on its own.
• If you are familiar with TDD, try to write the tests first.
• If you get stuck on an issue, or cannot easily satisfy all of the "done" criteria, move on to the next issue. The goal is to have some fresh work to discuss at your technical interview. Better half done than not done at all. Bonus, sometimes solving one problem will help you understand another.

The challenge is designed to take a maximum of 8 hours. If you can track your hours, try to match that time.
